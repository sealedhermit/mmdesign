## Overview

We built a web application designed to record, preserve and share precious family moments.

Very briefly, we allow users to create account, upload and share family photos and artifacts with other family members. Users can connect with relatives, create family groups and collaborate with the whole family by sharing photos, memories and events in a single group.
