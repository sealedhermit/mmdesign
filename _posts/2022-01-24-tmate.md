## Overview

Want to do pair programming with your buddies over the net? Do you like **tmux**?

Enter **tmate**.

## Key points

Briefly,

1. `tmate` is a fork of [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) - this means that `tmate` is also a terminal multiplexer and we can reuse our favourite `.tmux.conf` and feel very much at home.
2. Once a `tmate` session has been created, others can ssh connect to the session and do live pair programming in the terminal at the same time. There's also an option for READ only sharing.
3. `tmate` session can be used for remote access purposes as well.
4. By default, we get random ephemeral connection string like `ssh vbBK63dtemNN2ppDUqSvYNqbD@nyc1.tmate.io`. It is possible to "name" the session and make the connection string deterministic and stable across restarts. Check out the [docs](https://tmate.io/#named_sessions) for more info.
5. But what if I want to prevent strangers from joining my session?\
   Easy! Pass in an `authorized_keys` file containing authorized public keys we want to allow connecting to the session.
6. Want to go super secure? Go [host your own tmate servers](https://tmate.io/#host)!

**TLDR**? `tmate` is basically a reverse ssh tunnel accessible from anywhere.

## Installation

I recommend checking out installation guide at [https://tmate.io/#installation](https://tmate.io/#installation){:target="\_blank"}.

For me I used the following commands

```bash
▶ curl -Ls https://github.com/tmate-io/tmate/releases/download/2.4.0/tmate-2.4.0-static-linux-amd64.tar.xz | tar xf - -C /tmp -J
▶ sudo mv /tmp/tmate-2.4.0-static-linux-amd64/tmate /usr/local/bin
▶ tmate -V
tmate 2.4.0
```

## Usage

- Start a `tmate` session
  ```bash
  ▶ tmate
  ```
- Start a `tmate` session, allowing only authorized SSH clients to connect
  ```bash
  tmate -a authorized_keys
  ```
  Where `authorized_keys` contains public keys that are allowed to connect
- Grab ssh connection string within `tmate` session
  ```bash
  ▶ tmate show-messages

  ```
- On client device, connect to the session via ssh / web (https).\
  For example, using the connection strings above
  ```bash
  ssh ro-tnLSDQsQD5W9SyqXJB3EaUAWQ@sfo2.tmate.io # Read only
  ssh sn6U6B4QAEehNAUznSu8Q2kSg@sfo2.tmate.io
  ```
