title: "Delete Repeated Characters with Costs"
---

You are given a lowercase alphabet string `s` and a list of non-negative integers `costs`, both of which have the same length. You can remove character `s[i]` for cost `costs[i]`, after which both `s[i]` and `costs[i]` is removed.

Return the minimum cost needed to delete all consecutively repeating characters.

**Constraints**

- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `s` and `costs`
