Given lowercase alphabet strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

**Constraints**

- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100` where `n` is the length of `a`
- `0 ≤ m ≤ 100` where `m` is the length of `b`
- `0 ≤ k ≤ 100` where `k` is the length of `c`

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input**

- a = `epidemiologist`
- b = `refrigeration`
- c = `supercalifragilisticexpialodocious`

**Output**

- answer = `5`

**Explanation**

The longest common subsequence is "eieio".
