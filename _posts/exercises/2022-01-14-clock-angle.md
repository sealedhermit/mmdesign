Given a clock time with `hour` and integer `minutes`, determine the smaller angle between the hour and the minute hands and floor it to the nearest integer.

Note that the hour hand moves too.

Bonus: When, during the course of a day, will the angle be zero?

**Constraints**

- `0 ≤ hour ≤ 23`
- `0 ≤ minutes ≤ 59`
