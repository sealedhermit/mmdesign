Given a list of positive integers `nums`, return whether you can divide the list into two groups `a` and `b` such that:

- The sum of `a` and the sum of `b` are equal.
- Every number in `a` is strictly less than every number in `b`.

**Constraints**

- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input**

- nums = `[9, 9]`

**Output**

- answer = `False`

**Explanation**

We can have `a = [9]` and `b = [9]` but it doesn't meet this criteria: "Every number in `a` is strictly less than every number in `b`."

### Example 2

**Input**

- nums = `[4, 9, 5]`

**Output**

- answer = `True`

**Explanation**

We can have `a = [4, 5]` and `b = [9]` and both of their sums are `9`.
