Given a list of list of positive integers `stacks`, you can take any stack(s) in `stacks` and pop any number of elements. Return the maximum sum that can be achieved such that all stacks have the same sum.

**Constraints**

- `n * m â‰¤ 500,000` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `stacks`

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input**

- stacks = `[[2, 3, 4, 5], [4, 5, 2, 3, 3], [9, 1, 1, 1]]`

**Output**

- answer = `9`

**Explanation**

Here are the operations we can take

- Pop `[5]` from the first stack to get `[2, 3, 4]` for a sum of `9`.
- Pop `[2, 3, 3]` from the second stack to get `[4, 5]` for a sum of `9`.
- Pop `[1, 1, 1]` from the first stack to get `[9]` for a sum of `9`.

### Example 2

**Input**

- stacks = `[[5, 13], [7, 2], [50]]`

**Output**

- answer = `0`

**Explanation**

We have to pop all elements from every stack since there's no way to make the three stacks have equal sum otherwise.
