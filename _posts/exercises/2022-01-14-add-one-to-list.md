You are given a list of integers `nums`, representing a decimal number and `nums[i]` is between `[0, 9]`.

For example, `[1, 3, 9]` represents the number `139`.

Return the same list in the same representation except modified so that `1` is added to the number.

**Constraints**

- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`.
