You are given a list of integers `nums` where each value represents a group of people looking to skydive together. You are also given `k` representing the number of days the skydiving facility is open for.

Return the minimum capacity of the plane you need to be able to fulfill all requests in `k` days. Note that requests should be fulfilled in the order they were given and a plane can only have one flight per day.

**Constraints**

- `n â‰¤ 10,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`.
