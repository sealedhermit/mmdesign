title: "Log Truncation"
---

You are given a list of integers `logs` and an integer `limit`. Each element in `logs[i]` represents the size of logs generated by user `i`. `limit` represents the total size of logs you can store in your system.

Return the largest `x` such that if we truncate every log in `logs` to be at most size `x`, the sum of the remaining log sizes is at most `limit`. If no log needs to be truncated, return the largest log size.

**Constraints**

- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `logs`
- `1 ≤ limit < 2 ** 31`

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input**

- logs = `[50, 20, 1000, 50, 400]`
- limit = `300`

**Output**

- answer = `90`

**Explanation**

If we truncate logs to `90`, then we get `[50, 20, 90, 50, 90]` and its sum is `300`

### Example 2

**Input**

- logs = `[2, 3, 7]`
- limit = `100`

**Output**

- answer = `7`

**Explanation**

No message needs to be truncated, so we return the max log size.
