Given a two-dimensional integer `matrix` of `1`s and `0`s where `0` represents empty cell and `1` represents a block that forms a shape, return the perimeter of the shape. There is guaranteed to be exactly one shape, and the shape has no holes in it.

**Constraints**

- `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 250` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
