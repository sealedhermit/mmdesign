Given a list of integers `nums` sorted in ascending order and an integer `k`, return whether any two elements from the list add up to `k`. You may **not** use the same element twice.

Note: Numbers can be negative or 0.

This should be done in $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$ space.

**Constraints**

- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input**

- nums = `[1, 3, 5, 8]`
- k = `6`

**Output**

- answer = `True`

**Explanation**

We can have `1 + 5 = 6`.

### Example 2

**Input**

- nums = `[1, 3, 5, 8]`
- k = `7`

**Output**

- answer = `False`

**Explanation**

There's no two numbers that add up to `7`.
