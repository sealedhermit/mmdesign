Given a two-dimensional integer `matrix` of 1s and 0s, return the number of "islands" in the matrix. A `1` represents land and `0` represents water, so an island is a group of 1s that are neighboring whose perimeter is surrounded by water.

Note: Neighbors can only be directly horizontal or vertical, not diagonal.

**Constraints**

- `n, m â‰¤ 100` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`.
