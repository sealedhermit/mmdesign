You are given a two-dimensional integer list `requested_trips` containing `[start_x, end_x, num_passengers]`, and an integer `capacity`. Each requested trip asks to pick up `num_passengers` passenger at `start_x` and drop them off at `end_x`. You also have a car with the given `capacity`, and start at `x = 0`.

Given that you'd like to pick up every passenger and can only move right, return whether you can pick up and drop off everyone.

**Constraints**

- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `requested_trips`
