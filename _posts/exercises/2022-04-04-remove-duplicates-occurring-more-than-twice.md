Given a list of integers `nums` sorted in ascending order, remove in-place duplicates that appear more than twice.

This should be done in $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$ space.

**Constraints**

- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input**

- nums = `[1, 1]`

**Output**

- answer = `[1, 1]`

### Example 2

**Input**

- nums = `[3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 8]`

**Output**

- answer = `[3, 3, 4, 4, 8]`

**Explanation**

We remove the third and fourth `3` since they occur more than twice.
