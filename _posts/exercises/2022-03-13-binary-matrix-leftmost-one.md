You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `matrix` which contains `1`s and `0`s. Given that each row is sorted in ascending order with `0`s coming before `1`s, return the leftmost column index with the value of `1`. If there's no row with a `1`, return `-1`.

Can you solve it faster than $$\mathcal{O}(nm)$$.

**Constraints**

- `n, m â‰¤ 250` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input**

- matrix = `[[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1]]`

**Output**

- answer = `1`

**Explanation**

The last row contains the leftmost column with a one at index `1`.
