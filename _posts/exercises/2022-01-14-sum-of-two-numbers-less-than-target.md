Given a list of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the sum of the largest pair of numbers in `nums` whose sum is less than `target`. You can assume that there is a solution.

**Constraints**

- `2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input**

- nums = `[5, 1, 2, 3]`
- target = `4`

**Output**

- answer = `3`

**Explanation**

Sum of the largest pair of numbers less than `4` is `1 + 2 = 3`.
