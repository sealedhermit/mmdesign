You are given a list of integers `nums` and an integer `n`. Given you must remove exactly `n` numbers, return the least number of unique integers after the removals.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `items`

## Examples
### Example 1

**Input**

- items = `[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]`
- n = `2`

**Output**

- answer = `1`


**Explanation**

We can delete the two `0`s to get `1`s. Then there's only `1` unique ID left.

### Example 2

**Input**

- items = `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3]`
- n = `2`

**Output**

- answer = `2`


**Explanation**

We can delete the `2` and the `3` to get `[0, 0, 1, 1]`. Then there's only `2` unique ID left.
