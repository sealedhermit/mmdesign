You are given a list of integers `nums` that used to be an arithmetic sequence. Given that a number was removed, and that the number was not the first or the last element, return the removed number.

**Constraints**

- `2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000`

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input**

- nums = `[1, 3, 5, 9]`

**Output**

- answer = `7`

**Explanation**

If we add `7` in to this sequence, we get `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]` which is an arithmetic sequence.
