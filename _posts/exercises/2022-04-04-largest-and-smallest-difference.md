Given a list of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, choose elements from `nums` to create a list of length `k` such that the difference between the largest integer in the list and the smallest integer is minimized. Return this difference.

**Constraints**

- `k ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
