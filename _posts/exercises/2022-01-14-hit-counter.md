Implement a hit counter which keeps track of number of the number of hits in the last `60` seconds.

- `add(int timestamp)` which adds `timestamp` in seconds in the hit counter
- `count(int timestamp)` which returns the number of hits that have been made in the last `60` seconds, given the current time is `timestamp`.

You can assume that the timestamps passed into `add` and `count` are monotonically increasing.

**Constraints**

- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of calls that are made to `add` and `count`

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input**

- methods = `['constructor', 'add', 'add', 'count', 'add', 'count']`
- arguments = `[[], [10], [40], [40], [70], [100]]`

**Output**

- answer = `[None, None, None, 2, None, 2]`

**Explanation**

- We create a `HitCounter`
- We add timestamp `10` to the data structure
- We add timestamp `40` to the data structure
- We count the number of timestamps that are within last `60` seconds of `40`. There's `10` and `40` so we return `2`
- We add timestamp `70` to the data structure
- We count the number of timestamps that are within last `60` seconds of `100`. There's `40` and `70` so we return `2`
