Given two strings `a` and `b` that represent binary numbers, add them and return their sum, also as a string.

The input strings are guaranteed to be non-empty and contain only `1`s and `0`s.

**Constraints**

- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `a`
- `m ≤ 100,000` where `m` is the length of `b`
