Given a list of integers `nums`, split it into two lists of equal size where the absolute difference between each list's median is as small as possible and return this difference.

Note: `length of nums / 2` is guaranteed to be odd.

**Constraints**

- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input**

- nums = `[1, 9, 7, 4, 3, 6]`

**Output**

- answer = `2`

**Explanation**

We can partition the list into `[1, 4, 9]` and `[3, 6, 7]`. Their medians are `4` and `6` and `abs(4 - 6) = 2`
