You are given a two-dimensional integer `matrix` of `1`s and `0`s, where a `1` represents a bomb and `0` represents an empty cell. When a bomb explodes, all the spaces along on the same row and column are damaged. Return the number of spaces you can stand in to not get damaged.

**Constraints**

- `n * m â‰¤ 200,000` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`.
