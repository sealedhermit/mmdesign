You are given a list of integers `prices` where `prices[i]` represents the price to sell a rod of size `i + 1`, and an integer `n` which represents the current size of the rod.

Given you can cut the rod into any number of different sizes, return the maximum profit that can be earned.

**Constraints**

- `m = n â‰¤ 1000` where `m` is the length of `prices`.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input**

- prices = `[1, 3, 5, 7, 7, 7]`
- n = `6`

**Output**

- answer = `10`

**Explanation**

The price table shows that we can

- Sell a rod of size `1` for price of `1`
- Sell a rod of size `2` for price of `3`
- Sell a rod of size `3` for price of `5`
- Sell a rod of size `4` for price of `7`
- Sell a rod of size `5` for price of `7`
- Sell a rod of size `6` for price of `7`

The optimal way to cut the rod is to split it into `2` pieces of length `3`, to achieve profit of `10`.
