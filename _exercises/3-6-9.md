Given an integer `n`, return a list with each number from 1 to `n`, except if it's a multiple of 3 or has a 3, 6, or 9 in the number, it should be the string `"clap"`.

Note: return the number as a string.

**Constraints**

- `n â‰¤ 100,000`

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input**

- n = `16`

**Output**

- answer = `['1', '2', 'clap', '4', '5', 'clap', '7', '8', 'clap', '10', '11', 'clap', 'clap', '14', 'clap', 'clap']`

**Explanation**

- 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 are replaced by "clap" since they are divisible by 3.
- 13 is replaced since it has a 3 in the number.
- 16 is replaced since it has a 6 in the number.
