Given a list of integers `nums`, return whether you can rearrange the order of `nums` such that the difference between every consecutive two numbers is the same.

**Constraints**

- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input**

- nums = `[1, 5, 1, 5, 1, 5]`

**Output**

- answer = `False`

**Explanation**

The difference between every consecutive two numbers alternates between `4` and `-4`.

### Example 2

**Input**

- nums = `[7, 1, 5, 3]`

**Output**

- answer = `True`

**Explanation**

If we rearrange `nums` to `[1, 3, 5, 7]`, then the difference between every two consecutive numbers is `2`.
