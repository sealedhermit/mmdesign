A Roomba robot is currently sitting in a Cartesian plane at `(0, 0)`. You are given a list of its `moves` that it will make, containing `NORTH`, `SOUTH`, `WEST`, and `EAST`.

Return whether after its moves it will end up in the coordinate `(x, y)`.

**Constraints**

- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is length of `moves`

This Roomba will end up at `(0, 0)`

### Example 2

**Input**

- moves = `['NORTH', 'EAST']`
- x = `1`
- y = `1`
